# networkTests
Tests for comparing ccNetViz against alternatives.

This repository should result in two tables comparing ccNetViz
to other solutions for visualizing networks in JS:

1. Performance benchmark -- rendering time (and any others that you and Ales would be useful) for various networks of increasing sizes
2. Feature comparison table that would illustrate how ccNetViz fits in with other network visualization tools (e.g., cytoscape.js, sigma, and a few other ones -- perhaps no more than 5?)

The performance benchmark would be done for the same net visualization tools that would be compared in the feature comparison table.

Software to compare ccNetViz against:
* slim D3 plot of the implemented layouts. (I can implement this)
* Cytoscape.JS
* SigmaJS
* JSNetworkX
* https://github.com/graphistry/pygraphistry
* Other software I find best by researching.

Probably limit the number of software to 5 (+ccNetViz).
